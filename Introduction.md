SS-map is a tool to visualize the secondary structure present in (computationally generated) ensembles of proteins, typically Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.

The science behind these code and its use is described in a publication submitted to _Intrinsically Disordered Proteins_ journal. If you use SS-map, please cite this publication (when of if accepted, details will be updated):

This wiki explains how to use the code and shows how the examples in the publications were generated.
